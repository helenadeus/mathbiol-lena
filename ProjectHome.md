Mathbiol is my pet project for the exploration of biological data using Machine Learning techniques and javascript.

The "Compstats" repository (browse the Source, select "compstats" as the mercurial repository) has all my modules for computational statistics, slowly being recoded to match Matlab sintax. Eventually compstats will have its own google project. Check the Wiki for documentation and examples.

The other repositories have a few other projects I am working on.
To download the code, use mercurial - through windows, you can use tortoiseHG as a client and in mac, sourceTree is a good option. You will need to chose a repository to download code from, for example:

```
hg clone https://helenadeus@code.google.com/p/mathbiol-lena/ 
```

Currently the most active project is the dendrogram:

(it is temporarily broken in google chrome.. working on that - try firefox or safari :( )
